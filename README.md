## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps
Instagram
- Changing the background color of the messages screen
- Deleting old messages
TikTok
- ability to share videos to other applications
- next video loads while watching current
YouTube
- categorize videos based on tag
- have different tabs for different things
  
### Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
My idea is a travel companion app that makes trip planning both simple and social. Users could drag and drop activities into a daily schedule, add photos, and pin locations directly to a map. The app would work offline, so travelers donâ€™t have to worry about losing access without Wi-Fi, and trips could be shared with friends for collaborative planning. This would make it easier to organize itineraries and keep memories in one place.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was running into SSH auth issues, but fixed them after some troubleshooting. It was also a little confusing to locate some of the tools in XCode but I figured it out soon enough.
